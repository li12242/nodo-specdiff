=============

Spectral difference code for fluid flows.

-------------
The idea to write the code came from the cfd-online forum thread:
http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/main/107718-higher-order-spectral-difference-methods.html


Short history:
"cfd seeker" asked a question on Spectral Difference methods. "nikola-m" proposed a writing of the SD code from the scratch.
